#  Why Code?

Why should engineers in general, and racecar engineers in particular, learn to code?

Engineers are well-versed in appropriating and fashioning tools to help them *get stuff done*, often in the most pragmatic of ways. As well as knowing the theory, and appreciating the importance of accuracy and precision, they also know how to approximate, make trade-offs, and fashion one tool from another to suit a particular purpose.

Code can be handy thing for engineers to be familiar with for a couple of reasons. In the first case, it's a tool: if you need to automate a repetitive code computer based task, code can be great for that. If you want to be able to generate a season's worth of race history charts from laptime data relative to your driver, or the driver on the other side of the garage, it can do that to. In the second case, it's a tool for building tools. There's a well known principle in programming referred to as DRY: *Don't Repeat Yourself*. If you find you're writing the same bit of code over and over again, turn it into a function (a "macro" in spreadsheets), and then just keep reusing that function. If you want to create a simple dashboard view over a set of data, or a tool that lets you interactively explore the behaviour of an equation by attaching sliders to different paramters and charting the result, there's nothing to stop you.

The tools you create with code don't need to be perfect; they may be quick to produce, throwaway affairs that you knock up for a particular purpose; like the upturned bucket you use to create a quick step up to help you get something down from the high shelf in the workshop. They don't need to be useable by other people, or work in all cases, if you design them for  particular purpose and you know their limits. There's a good reason a lot of code useable by researchers is arcane and hard to use by anyone else: they built if for themselves, they know what it does, and it takes ten times as long to create a GUI that's useable by anyone else than one that works for you. It might not be pretty, but if it helps you get the job done, it's good enough.

Here are some of the things you can get up to with code; knowing a little bit of code will help you get started with any of them, even if they all seem very different:

- crunching data: from loading data in from large numbers of files, getting it into shape both literally (you want to pivot those rows to columns? Sure thing...) and figuratively (you need the data cleaning to remove outliers? No problem...), analysing it (doing the stats) and visualising it (charts as far as your eye can see), code can help: [example - shaping Le Mans 2019 data ](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/WEC/blob/master/notebooks/lemans19-wec.ipynb)], [visualising WEC pace at Spa](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/WEC/blob/master/notebooks/Pace%20Tables.ipynb);
- rich tables: sometimes you need a macroscope, a tool that lets you see *everything*; one way to achieve this is to produce tables that also embed charts. With a bit of code, you can create your own table+chart displays, and even tune them into interactive dashboards [[example — WRC rally summary tables](https://blog.ouseful.info/2019/02/15/tinkering-with-stage-charts-for-wrc-rally-sweden/)];
- custom charts and visualisations: sometimes, the standard line chart or bar plot doesn't cut it. If you can imagine something better, you might be able to build it... [[example - rally pace charts](https://github.com/psychemedia/WRC_sketches/blob/master/doodles/ewrc%20Rally%20Console.ipynb), [circuit race telemetry — driver DNA](https://blog.ouseful.info/2010/04/07/f1-data-junkie-driver-dna/), [generic circuit race telemetry charts](https://blog.ouseful.info/2012/03/14/plotting-latitude-and-longitude-with-ggplot-map-projections-in-r/), [interactive (old demo)](http://www.f1datajunkie.com/2011/08/f1-2010-belgium-hamiltons-mclaren.html)];
- map views: want to overlay your telemetry onto a Google map? Or display static map views? That's easy enough too... [[old example — driver comparison maps](https://blog.ouseful.info/2010/04/18/f1-data-junkie-mclaren-driver-comparison-snapshots/)]
- analysis and intelligence: you know there are patterns, features and stories in the data, but can you detect them and get them out? Code may be able to help... [[example — detecting undercuts](https://blog.ouseful.info/2015/07/11/detecting-undercuts-in-f1-races-using-r/)]; we can also generate commentary / summary text reports from the data [[example](https://blog.ouseful.info/2020/01/07/simple-rule-based-approach-in-python-for-generating-explanatory-texts-from-pandas-dataframes/)];
- scraping data: sometimes the data you want isn't available in the form you want it; it may be locked in PDF documents, or posted on a website as HTML tables [[example - code for scraping eWRC results](https://github.com/psychemedia/WRC_sketches/blob/master/doodles/ewrc_api.py), [TSL PDF scraper](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/TSL/blob/master/notebooks/TSL%20PDF%20Scraper%20(R).ipynb), [TSL live timing scraper](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/TSL/blob/master/notebooks/TSL%20Timing%20Screen%20Screenshot%20and%20Data%20Grabber.ipynb)];
- doing the car setup maths [[example — car setup](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/coding_for_racecar_engineers/blob/master/Occupational%20Therapy.ipynb)]: if you've ever used tools like MATLAB or Mathematica, you'll be familiar with the idea of writing equations that computers can crunch for you. They can solve equations, and chart them for you. And wrap them in interactive equations so you can explore them interactively. But you can use so called *symbolic maths* packages that plug in the ability to write and solve equations in other, nore general, programming languages too.

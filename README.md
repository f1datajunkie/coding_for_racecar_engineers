# Coding for Racecar Engineers
A series of occasional articles on *Coding for Racecar Engineers* presented as interactive computational notebooks.

The following binder link pulls the contents of the `master` branch in this repo into a base box created from the `binder` banch of this repo: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/f1datajunkie/coding_for_racecar_engineers/binder/?urlpath=git-pull?repo=https://github.com/f1datajunkie/coding_for_racecar_engineers)

Many of the notebooks are inspired by articles that originally appeared in [Racecar Engineering Magazine](https://www.racecar-engineering.com/).

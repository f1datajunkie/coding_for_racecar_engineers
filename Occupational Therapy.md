Secondly, as *computational* notebooks, they can can be used to record, *and execute*, mathematical and computational models.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll provide a complement to Danny Nowlan's \"Occupational Therapy\" *Chassis Simulation* column from the July, 2020, edition of *Racecar Engineering* magazine to show how how we\n\n\nElsewhere, we'll show how you can explore actual data sets, using data rather than an mathematical models, using hte computational notebook approach."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Programming Equations\n\nThe Python programming language is a general purpose programmging language that has been extended over the years by many thousanbds of community generated \"packages\" that perform a wide variety of computational tasks, from data analysis and chart plotting, to finite element analysis to symbolic computation.\n\n*Symbolic computaion*? What's that then...?\n\nMaths... Programmes that do maths. If you've ever used Mathcad or Mathematica, that's symbolic computation.\n\nIn this notebook, I'll introduce a Python programming package called `sympy`, and show you how you can use it to \"do maths\" in a computational notebook.\n\nOne reason I'm doing it this way, in a *Jupyter* notebook, rather than Mathcad or Mathematica,  is that Jupyter notebooks, the Python programming language, and the `sympy` package are all free, open source software. Another reason is that Jupyter notebooks are increasingly widely used in academic teaching and research, as well as industry. This means they provide a good basis for being able to share your work with others, as well allowing you to directly benefit from code other people have put out there that you can learn from and crib from too.."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
